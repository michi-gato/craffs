## Simple Handsewn Lap Quilt

#### Remembering how to make a lap quilt for welcoming newborn babies. The first one I made was almost three years ago when E was pregnant with O. I lost all of the pattern, measurement, and materials list for that project. Now that she is about to find out the sex of bb numero dos, I will document this second lap quilt.

Lap size is small than twin but bigger than crib. 

Supplies:
* 100% Wool Fiber Batt for hand-quilting, Size: 45″ x 72″, Weight: 1 lb.
* Two different pieces of 100% cotton fabric. slightly larger than the wool fiber. Should I go for linen?
* Keeping the same tan/brown striped cotton that I used on Oliver's but now I need to find a good subtle colorful pattern to balance the blue gingham. Maybe red
